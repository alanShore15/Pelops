<b>TakeMyPhone</b> is a way of smarter consumption. We buy customerâ€™s old smartphones and offer them high convenience and best price they can get anywhere in the market. In a fast developing country like India, with everyday changing trends and needs, there is nascent e-waste recycling industry. We at Take My Phone are working towards hassle-free recycling of e-waste. We find new homes for the repairable gadgets and recycle the dead ones and in the process, help the customer upgrade faster. </br></br>
